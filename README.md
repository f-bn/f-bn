**Hello there !** :raising_hand:

I'm **Florian**, I am 28 years old, I'm currently living near Lille (France) and working as an aspiring **Python developer** at [ADEO](https://www.adeo.com/) (previously **Database Engineer**).

### :rocket: My profile

* :construction_worker: Passionate system and database engineer, now aspiring developer
* :computer: I work mostly with Linux operating systems and database engines such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) :heart:, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Valkey](https://valkey.io/), and [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/). I love automating my work in every way possible, you will probably find me tinkering *too much* with various softwares to break things (because there is always something to learn).
* :zap: I may have a *passion* in debugging undocumented systems and database installations everywhere I go (please no :sweat_smile:).
* :seedling: Currently learning **Python** and **Golang**
* :tea: Tea lover and whisky amateur (always moderate drinking I promise :wink:)
* :headphones: Music addict
* :house: Homelaber (NAS and small custom server for my personal production)
* :mailbox_with_mail: You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-bobin/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fbn587)
