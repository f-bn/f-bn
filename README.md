**Hello there !** :raising_hand:

I'm **Florian Bobin**, I am 28 years old, I'm currently living near Lille (France) and working as an aspiring **Full-Stack developer** (previously **Cloud Database Engineer**) at [ADEO](https://www.adeo.com/).

### :rocket: My profile

* :construction_worker: Passionate system and database engineer, aspiring developer
* :zap: I may have a *passion* in debugging undocumented systems and database setups everywhere I go (please no :sweat_smile:).
* :computer: I work mostly with Linux operating systems and database engines such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) :heart:, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/). I also love automating my work in every way possible and you can also find me tinkering *too much* with various softwares to break things because there is always something to learn.
* :seedling: Currently learning **Python** and **Golang**
* :tea: Tea lover and whisky amateur (always moderate drinking I promise :wink:)
* :headphones: Music addict
* :house: Homelaber (NAS and small custom server for my personal production)
