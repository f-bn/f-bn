* :wrench: I work mostly with the GNU/Linux operating system, automating my work with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), tinkering *too much* with virtualization and containers techs (such as [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)) but also learning how databases works with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (and a spice of [GreenplumDB](https://greenplum.org/) at work)
