**Hello there !** :raising_hand:

I'm **Florian Bobin**, I am 25 years old, I live near Lille (France) :fr: and I'm currently working as systems and database engineer.

### :floppy_disk: cat .profile

* :construction_worker: Passionate Linux systems and database engineer
* :office: Work at [Worldline France](https://fr.worldline.com/fr/home.html)
* :wrench: I'm working mostly with the GNU/Linux operating system, automating my work with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), tinkering *too much* with virtualization and containers techs (such as [QEMU/KVM](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-KVM), [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [systemd-nspawn](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html)) but also learning how databases works with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (and a spice of [GreenplumDB](https://greenplum.org/) at work)
* :tea: Tea lover
* :headphones: Music addict
* :computer: Small *homelaber* : I've got a custom server for learning labs, but also few network devices
* :mailbox_with_mail: You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-bobin/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ruskofd_)
* :zap: fun fact : *I'm not using Arch btw* :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
