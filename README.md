**Hello there !** :raising_hand:

I'm **Florian Bobin**, I am 28 years old, I'm currently living near Lille (France) and working as **Cloud Database Engineer** at [Adeo Services](https://www.adeo.com/).

### :rocket: My profile

* :construction_worker: Passionate database engineer
* :computer: I work mostly with Linux operating systems and database engines such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) :heart:, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/). I also love automating my work in every way possible and you can also find me tinkering *too much* with various softwares to break things because there is always something to learn. I may also have a *passion* in debugging undocumented systems and database setups everywhere I go (please no).
* :tea: Tea lover
* :headphones: Music addict (mostly metal, but also some coldwave, trance, phonk, trailer music... and many others)
* :house: Homelaber sometimes (NAS and small custom server for labs around databases, Kubernetes and some other softwares)
* :mailbox_with_mail: You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-bobin/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fbn587)
