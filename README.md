* :wrench: I work mostly with Linux operating systems :penguin:, automating my work with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and tinkering *too much* with virtualization and containers techs (such as [QEMU/KVM](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/virtualization/what-is-KVM), [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)/[Podman](https://podman.io/))
* :book: Iâ€™m currently learning how databases works with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) :heart:, but also looking to develop my programming skills with [Golang](https://go.dev/) 
* :tea: Tea lover
* :musical_note: Music addict (mostly metal, but also some coldwave, trance, phonk, trailer music... and many others)
